Todo:
You should also write a ReadMe file inside of the project repository containing the following information about each team member:
- Their name
- The word or phrase describing their game mechanic
- A brief description of the 2 different implementations of their mechanic and which level the different implementations are used in.

- VG only: What AI units did the student create and which game mechanic/mechanics the AI units uses. If they use a game mechanic created by another team member, write their name in parentheses after the game mechanic’s name.




Who did what?

-------------------------------------------
Oskar:

I made two different flight based movement systems.
Both have been made to be easily configurable, and modular.

Version 1:

- Fuel based, if it runs out, you fall down. Found in level 1.

Version 2: 

- Floating movement. No gravity affects you. Found in level 2.

Ai's:
- In the first level I made three small companions that follow the player around using version 2 of my movement system.
- In the second level I made a enemy that will chase the player in the event of a collision, until another collision between them occur. Basically he gets mad that you hit him, so he tries to hit you back.

Emanoel:

I made different balls that gives the player different power-up.
The power-up can be an effect that is forever, or just in an amount of time. Default: 10 Seconds.

Version 1 - Level 1:
Different powerUps that is placed in the level.
When player is walking on it, a nice effect is shown while you gain a powerup.
Power up could be:
	•	Bigger Size
	•	Faster Movement Speed
	
Version 2 - Level 2:
A Powerup that effects the player and the enemy.
Giving the player positive stats and the enemy Negative stats
	•	Player: Faster Movement Speed, Enemy: Slower MovementSpeed	

Some extra PowerUps that was planning on being used, works but needs some different changes:
PowerUp: Teleport
Player gets two teleports within a time limit.
Works better if it is not a platformer view. (2D)
