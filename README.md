Who did what?


-------------------------------------------
Oskar:

I made two different flight based movement systems.

Version 1:

Fuel based, if it runs out, you fall down. Found in level 1.

Version 2: 

Floating movement. No gravity affects you. Found in level 2.

Ai's:
In the first level I made three small companions that follow the player around using version 2 of my movement system.
In the second level I made a enemy that will chase the player in the event of a collision, until another collision between them occur. Basically he gets mad that you hit him, so he tries to hit you back.
